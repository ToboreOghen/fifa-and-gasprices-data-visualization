# ⚽⛽ FIFA & Gas Prices Data Visualization

A data-visualization project using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.  
This project explores two datasets:  
- **FIFA Players dataset** (player potential, preferred foot, and weight)  
- **Global Gas Prices dataset** (price trends across multiple countries)  

Developed as part of my **AI and Data Science learning journey**, this project helped me strengthen my understanding of data analysis, data visualization, and working with real datasets in Python.

## 🎯 Project Overview

### 🏟️ FIFA Players Data  
- Visualized each club’s **overall player potential** using a **box plot**.  
- Analyzed the **distribution of players’ weights (in kilograms)** with a **histogram**.  
- Compared players’ **preferred foot** (left vs right) using a **pie chart**.  

### ⛽ Global Gas Prices Data  
- Created a **line chart** comparing gas prices for **three countries** (USA, Canada, and Australia).  
- Created another **line chart** comparing **twelve countries** together to visualize global trends.  

All visualizations were created on a single notebook page for simplicity and better organization.

## 🏆 Learning Outcome

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:  
- **Exploring and cleaning datasets** using Pandas and NumPy  
- **Building data visualizations** using Matplotlib  
- **Analyzing relationships** and trends from real-world data  
- **Presenting insights visually** in clear, interpretable formats  

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Add **correlation analysis** between player stats and potential.  
- Expand gas price data with **more countries** and **longer time periods**.  
- Experiment with **Seaborn** or **Plotly** for more interactive visualizations.  
- Begin integrating **machine learning** for prediction tasks.
